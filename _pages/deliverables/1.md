**Database gathering proofs from the proof systems Coq, HOL-Light and Matita, and their translations.**

The proofs translated to Dedukti, and from Dedukti to other provers, are not currently gathered into a single database:

- [Logipedia](http://logipedia.inria.fr/) is a browsable website providing a library of arithmetic theorems in various languages: Matita, Coq, Lean, PVS, OpenTheory, Dedukti. It has been obtained by translating the Matita arithmetic library to Dedukti and then to the other provers using [STTfaXport](https://github.com/Deducteam/sttfaxport).

- [Nubo](https://github.com/Deducteam/nubo/) is a set of metadata and scripts to download and check Dedukti libraries. It contains links to a number of proof libraries translated to Dedukti: the arithmetic library of Matita, some part of the Coq library GeoCoq on geometry, the OpenTheory library, some proofs generated by some old version of the veriT SMT prover, some proofs generated by the ZenonModulo theorem prover, some proofs from the Isabelle/HOL standard library.

- [matita\_lib\_in\_agda](https://github.com/thiagofelicissimo/matita_lib_in_agda) is a translation of Matita arithmetic library into Agda, using [predicativize](https://github.com/Deducteam/predicativize).

But more and newer libraries can now be automatically generated from HOL-Light and Isabelle/HOL using:

- [hol2dk](https://github.com/Deducteam/hol2dk) to translate HOL-Light files to Dedukti or Lambdapi, and then to Coq.

- [isabelle\_dedukti](https://github.com/Deducteam/isabelle_dedukti) to translate Isabelle/HOL proofs to Dedukti or Lambdapi, including proofs coming from the Isabelle Archive of Formal Proofs ([AFP](https://www.isa-afp.org/)).
