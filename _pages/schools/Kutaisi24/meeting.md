Will take place at Kutaisi International University, Kutaisi, Georgia, June 24th-28th 2024, organised by David Cerna and Besik Dundua.

### Aims:

The goal of the Summer School is to give participants a general overview on modern AI based techniques and tools for reasoning and mathematical knowledge management. The intended audience is computer science and mathematics students as well as researchers interested in this field. The offered courses are: 

- [Andrea Kohlhase](http://www.hnu.de/andrea-kohlhase), Hochschule Neu-Ulm, Germany (An Intro to Eye Tracking for a deeper Understanding of Interactions with Math)

- [Michael Kohlhase](http://www.dhss.phil.fau.de/person/michael-kohlhase/), University of Erlangen–Nuremberg, Germany (Symbolic Natural Language Processing in GLIF)

- [Peter Koepke](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/koepke/), University of Bonn, Germany (Natural language proving with Naproche)

- [Zarathustra Goertzel](https://gardenofminds.art/research/), Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics, Czechia (AI-Powered Theorem Prover Guidance)

- [Celine Hocquette](https://celinehocquette.github.io/), University of Oxford, United Kingdom (ILP, symbolic AI)

- [Yutaka Nagashisma](https://unitedreasoning.wordpress.com/about/), Czech Academy Of Sciences, Czechia (Interactive Theorem Proving in Isabelle/HOL and Its AI-Driven Automation Efforts)

- [David Cerna](http://www.cs.cas.cz/dcerna/), Czech Academy Of Sciences, Czechia (Computational Proof Theory: Transforming Proofs using Automated Reasoning)

### Directions:

From Kutaisi International Airport, take a bus to the city center for around €4. Alternatively, you can take a taxi for about €10. From the city center to Kutaisi International University, there is bus N3 which you can pay for with a card only. However, taking a taxi is faster.

You can also order a taxi directly from the airport to the university without going to the city center. For finding out public transport routes and schedules, you can use the Moovit app, or use taxi apps for a more convenient experience.
